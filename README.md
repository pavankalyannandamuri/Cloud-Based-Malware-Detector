# DSCI6015-Midterm-MalConv-Malware-Classification

## Project Overview
Welcome to the DSCI6015 SP24 Midterm Project - Cloud-based PE Malware Detection API. This project is part of the Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity course (DSCI 6015) for the Spring 2024 semester at the University of New Haven, instructed by Professor Vahid Behzadan.

## Project Description
This project aims to implement and deploy a machine-learning model for malware classification using the MalConv architecture. The model is trained to classify Portable Executable (PE) files as either malware or benign. The project is divided into three main tasks:

### Task 1 – Building and Training the Model
In this task, a deep neural network based on the MalConv architecture is developed using Python 3.10 and PyTorch (2.x). The EMBER-2018 v2 dataset is used for training, and modifications are made to the provided sample implementation in the EMBER repository to meet project requirements. The model is documented in a Jupyter Notebook, and training can be accelerated using cloud platforms such as Google Colab or AWS Sagemaker.

### Task 2 - Deploying the Model as a Cloud API
Once the model is successfully trained, it is deployed as a cloud API using Amazon EC2 and flask. This enables other applications to utilize the model in real-time for malware classification.

### Task 3 – Creating a Web Client
For the final task, a user-friendly web application is developed using Streamlit. Users can upload PE files, which are then converted into a feature vector compatible with the MalConv/EMBER model. The feature vector is sent to the deployed API, and the results (Malware or Benign) are displayed to the user.
